# Feba66s-FurryPaws-Script

This is a Tampermonkey/Greasemonkey/etc. script

Create a new script -> paste this script -> save

go to a dogs page to automatically collect its data, lvlups, event nights and the stats.

if you go to the overview page there will be all the collected data in csv format in the console
also all dog names that are not 100% taken care off will be thrown into the console aswell

No warranty etc. use at your own risk


Kah said "[...]Generally, unless something becomes problematic (unduly increasing server load, providing too extreme of an advantage according to my discretion, etc) it is tentatively allowed. Obviously, if anything is being done that is considered an exploit of a bug (as happened a few years ago) it is strongly prohibited. Botting is also strongly prohibited. But generally, external scripts that just make your time on FP more enjoyable are allowed unless they become problematic.[...]"

So I think this script is "safe"
